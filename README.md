# AirBnB Clone Project

## About the Project
The AirBnB Clone Project is a comprehensive full-stack simulation of a property rental platform similar to AirBnB. It is designed to immerse developers in real-world backend systems, API development, database design, and deployment strategies. The goal is to build a secure, scalable, and modular web application.

## Project Goals
- Secure user management and authentication
- Full CRUD operations for properties and bookings
- Integrated payment processing
- Review and rating system
- Efficient data handling with optimization and caching

## Tech Stack
- Backend Framework: Django, Django REST Framework
- Database: PostgreSQL
- API Protocols: RESTful API & GraphQL
- Task Queue: Celery
- Caching: Redis
- Containization: Docker
- Deployment & CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Docker Compose

## Team Roles
The AirBnB Clone project was a collaborative effort requring distinct responsibilities distributed across several specialized roles. Each role contributed significantly to the successful planning, development, and delivery of the platform.

## Backend Developer
Responsible for building and maintaining all API endpoints, implementing business logic, and integrating third-party services like payment gateways. Ensures code quality, unit testing, and adheres to RESTful and GraphQL standards.

## Database Adminstrator (DBA)
Designed and optimized the relational database schema using PostgreSQL. Implemented indexing strategies and managed data integrity, backups, and migrations for consistent performance and reliability.

## DevOps Engineer
Handled the deployment process using Docker and CI/CD pipelines. Ensured the application ran smoothly across development and production environments, monitored server health, and managed automated testing and releases.

## QA Engineer
Tested each feature for functionally, security, and performance. Wrote automated tests, reported bugs, and ensured that all components met the defined requirements and quality standards before deployment.

## Technology Stack
This project integrates a variety of modern technologies,each serving a specific purpose in building a robust, scalable, and efficient AirBnB-like booking platform.
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used to develop the backend logic and RESTful APIs quickly and securely.
- Django REST Framework: An extension of Django used to build powerful, flexible, and well-documented RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A robust relational database system used to store structured data like users, properties, bookings, and reviews.
- GraphQL: A query language and runtime for APIs, allowing clients to request only the data they need, improving performance and flexibility.
- Celery: An asynchronous task queue used for background tasks like sending notifications and processing time-consuming operations.
- Redis: A fast in-memory key-value store used to manage session data and caching, improving application speed and performance.
- Docker: A containerization tool used to create consistent development, testing, and production environments across all machines.
- CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions): Automated tools for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring code changes are tested and deployed efficiently.
